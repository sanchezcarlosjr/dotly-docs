## ðŸ˜¬ Important notes
### During the installation
- **Where are going to be located your dotfiles?**
1. press `Enter` if you ok with the default location (`~/.dotfiles`)
2. if you want a custom location, the path should include the name of your new dotfiles folder (ex.
`~/Documents/workspace/<folder_name>`), **you don't need to create it manually, if you do that, you'll get a .back folder of your 
empty folder**
- **Selecting authentication method**
if you are going to clone your repo using the **Other git alternative**, before this, you need to create an ssh key and it to your 
github account. For more information check this [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
